# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.
 
 Hello! My name is Zaynab, and I'm double majoring in Global Middle Eastern Studies and Business/Econ. To be completely honest, I have no prior experience in programming, and I'm not much of a gamer, so I recognize that this class is a bit outside my usual wheelhouse. However, I’m genuinely dedicated to learning and acquiring some coding skills while exploring new fields and cultures.

I had a brief introduction to gaming towards the end of my freshman year in my humanities class, which is what inspired me to take this course as a general education requirement. I’m excited to expand my knowledge, and I appreciate your patience as I learn. I’ll definitely be picking your brains and utilizing as many resources as possible along the way!

Looking forward to working with all of you!

3. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ ] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [v] Other (please specify) - Global Middle Eastern Studies & Business Econ

4. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

 In this class, I’m hoping to gain a foundational understanding of programming and game design. Since I have no prior experience in this field, I aim to learn the essential coding skills that will allow me to create simple games and interactive experiences. I’m particularly interested in exploring how game design can be used as a medium for storytelling and cultural expression.

Additionally, I hope to connect with my classmates and collaborate on projects, as I believe learning from others will enhance my understanding of the material. Ultimately, I want to leave this class with a sense of confidence in my abilities and a better appreciation for the art and science behind game development.

6. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

I’m definitely excited about this class, but I can’t help but feel a bit nervous too. While my lack of experience motivates me to learn, I worry that it might be a disadvantage since I don’t know even the basics about gaming. To ease my nerves, I went home after the first day and asked my brother, who’s really into gaming, a bunch of questions to get some insights.

I’m hoping that by being open about where I’m starting, I can catch up and make the most of this experience. I'm looking forward to learning, even if it means stepping out of my comfort zone!

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)
   0
2. Game development (any engine)
   0
3. Unity

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
   N/A
2. Scope management
